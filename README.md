**Source of the Dataset**:

The Dataset that we have chosen is the one provided in a hackathon called BitCamp-2024 which was held at the University of Maryland College Park. 
The dataset contains information about loan repayments and loan defaults. The Second dataset contains various storm event datas. We had to change the second data set as the one proposed in the project proposal has very less precision. The data set we have chosen now has high precision.
